    The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without
    compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud
    infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across
    multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that
    you can survive regional outages.
