### Getting and keeping in touch

#### Mailing lists<a name="mailing"></a>

Discussion and questions on Cassandra's usage and development happens mainly on the following mailing lists:

* [Users](http://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/): General mailing list for user questions and
  discussions. This is also where new releases are announced ([subscribe](user-subscribe@cassandra.apache.org) |
  [unsubscribe](user-unsubscribe@cassandra.apache.org) |
  [Archives](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?user@cassandra.apache.org)).
* [Developers](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@cassandra.apache.org/): Questions and discussions related to Cassandra
  development ([subscribe](user-subscribe@cassandra.apache.org) | [unsubscribe](dev-unsubscribe@cassandra.apache.org) |
  [Archives](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@cassandra.apache.org)).
* [Commits](http://www.mail-archive.com/commits@cassandra.apache.org/): Notification on commits done to the source
  repository and on [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA) updates. This is a fairly noisy mailing list
  mostly useful for Cassandra developers and those who would like to keep close tabs on Cassandra's development
  ([subscribe](commits-subscribe@cassandra.apache.org) | [unsubscribe](commits-unsubscribe@cassandra.apache.org) |
  [Archives](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?commits@cassandra.apache.org)).

### Reporting bugs

If you encounter a problem with Cassandra, the first places to ask for help are the [user mailing list](#mailing)
and the `#cassandra` [IRC channel](#irc).

If, after having asked for help, you suspect that you have found a bug in Cassandra, you should report it by opening a
ticket through the [Apache Cassandra JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA). Please provide as much
details as you can on your problem, and don't forget to indicate which version of Cassandra you are running and on which
environment.
